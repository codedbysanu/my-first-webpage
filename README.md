# my-first-webpage
It's my first web page made with love and dedication, I self-taught myself html in the winter break after my first sem in AI &amp; ML diploma ended to prepare myself for the subjects that are about to come in 2nd sem for example C language, linux and web page designing. I'm really excited to learn more and become an expert one day!
